           <h3><b> Factory History of Beatee Agro-Processing</b> </h3>
           Beatee Agro-Processing, located in <b> Warakese, Mampong-Ashanti,</b> stands as a remarkable example of perseverance, innovation, and family-driven entrepreneurship. 
           Its roots trace back to <b>1981,</b> when <b>Stella Anane,</b> a visionary woman and devoted mother, began roasting gari using a small rounded pan primarily to feed her family during that year. What started as a modest effort to sustain her household soon blossomed into a small-scale gari production venture.<br><br>
           Initially, the factory was named <b> Nyame Na Ayɛ Gari Factory,</b> reflecting Stella’s deep faith and gratitude to God. However, when it became necessary to officially register the business, her daughter, Afi Juliana Yamenuie, took up the mantle. Upon attempting to register the factory, they discovered that the original name had already been claimed. 
           They then opted for a new name: <b>DAGBA Gari Factory</b> a compromise, though later it turned out the intended name was <b>Daavi Gari Factory,</b> and the spelling was mistakenly registered as "DAGBA," a name with no clear meaning to the family. The factory was register on the <b> 11th day of November 2014.</b> 
           <br><br>
           As the matriarch Stella Anane passed away, her daughter <b>Juliana Afi Yamenu</b> fully took over the operations, funding the business with her personal savings. Despite her limited formal education, Juliana pressed forward with determination. She was greatly supported by her own daughter,<b> Beatrice Ayawo Nyamadzorse,</b> who assisted with managing and modernizing the business. 
           <br><br>
           A significant turning point came in <b>2020,</b> when the factory diversified its offerings. Moving beyond the production of plain gari to different kinds of gari.<b> Beatee Agro-Processing</b> began innovating by introducing fortified gari products to the local market. These included:<br>
            <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
            <b><li>Fortified Coconut Gari</li>
              <li>Fortified Margarine Gari</li>
              <li>Fortified Soya Bean Gari</li></b>
            </ul>
            This innovation not only added value to the traditional gari product but also positioned the factory as a forward-thinking agro-processing enterprise in the region.
            Despite the initial brand confusion surrounding the name "DAGBA," and the increasing number of customers asking for the meaning of the name, the family made a decisive branding change. 
            They rebranded the business under a name that was more personal, meaningful, and reflective of the family’s efforts and leadership. Hence, the factory was renamed Beatee Agro-Processing, inspired by Beatrice’s support and involvement in the growth of the business.
            <br><br>
            Today, <b> Beatee Agro-Processing</b> stands as a symbol of resilience, generational effort, and innovation in local agro-processing. From humble beginnings to a registered and evolving enterprise, the factory not only contributes to local employment and food processing but also demonstrates how traditional skills can be passed down, reimagined, and scaled for the future.
